# Wine_Quality_Prediction

This repository contains a project for predicting the quality of white wine using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## Project Overview

The project uses a dataset of white wine quality and applies machine learning techniques to predict the wine quality based on its physicochemical properties.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is available [here](https://github.com/YBIFoundation/Dataset/raw/main/WhiteWineQuality.csv).

## Project Structure

- `Wine_Quality_Prediction.ipynb`: The notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, visualization, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
